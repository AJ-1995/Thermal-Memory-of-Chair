## Description of dataset 
Data Source:
The infrared image data utilised in this study was captured using a FLIR ONE infrared camera and a Xiaomi 9 mobile phone.

Data Content:
This dataset comprises 360 infrared images of chair surfaces captured across nine distinct seated postures from 40 subjects. It further includes over 8,000 infrared images augmented using generative models. Finally, it incorporates a validation set of infrared images depicting subjects seated on chairs with varying material surfaces and maintaining different postures for varying durations. All data was acquired under controlled seated conditions.

Data representation: In this dataset, infrared images are in JPEG format.
